/**
* Here is the list of routes (URIs) to controllers and their actions. Routes are
* considered in order - first matching route will be used.
* 
* Four generic routes at the end of the list are enough for every application.
*
* Search engine friendly URIs can be also defined here. Consider to setup SEF URIs
* at the end of the development or at least not at the begining.
* 
* In your templates build links always this way
*	
*		{a controller=creatures action=detail id=$creature}Details of the creature{/a}
*
* According the matching generic route, link will look like
*
*			/en/creatures/detail/?id=123
*
* When there is a SEF route before the generic form...
*
* 	$this->addRoute("/creature-<id>/","creatures/detail",array("id" => "/[0-9]+/"));
*
* previous link will be changed automatically to the following one
*
*			/creature-123/
*
* And even more when a visitor visits previous link directly (i.e. from a bookmarks),
* he will be transparently redicted to the new one.
